Settings-\u003eGeneral-\u003eVisibility-\u003eCI/CD should be enabled and set to \"Everyone with access\".\r\n2. Settings-\u003eCI/CD-\u003eGeneral Pipelines timeout should be set to \u003e3h .\r\n3. The \"Allow commits from members who can merge to the target branch.\" option check box at the bottom of your merge request must be checked.\r\n\r\n#General Guidelines:\r\n1. Do not submit a merge request against the master branch of your fork.  Always create a new branch for merge requests.\r\n2. Make sure your code submission follows the [KiCad Coding Style Policy](Documentation/development/coding-style-policy.md).\r\n3. Make sure all User Interface changes follow the [User Interface Guidelines](Documentation/development/ui-policy.md).\r\n4. Give merge requests a short and descriptive title that summarizes the major changes it contains (not just an issue number). A longer description of the changes should be contained inside the description of the merge request.\r\n---------Add your merge request details below----------- --\u003e","merge_pipelines_enabled":false,"merge_trains_enabled":false,"only_allow_merge_if_all_status_checks_passed":false,"allow_pipeline_trigger_approve_deployment":false,"permissions":{"project_access":null,"group_access":null}}
